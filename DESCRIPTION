Title: A Framework for Training Multiple Models Using the Caret Package
Version: 0.7.0.0
Authors@R: person("Lars", "Kjeldgaard", email = "lars_kjeldgaard@hotmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A minimal framework to create, manage and train multiple models using 
    the caret package. A model grid consists of two components: a set of 
    settings that are shared by all models, and specifications that apply only 
    to the indivual models. When the model grid is trained, model and training
    specifications are first consolidated from the shared and the model specific 
    settings into complete configurations. These configurations are trained
    with the famous 'train' function from the 'caret' package.

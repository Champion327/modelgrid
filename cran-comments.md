## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Written package names, software names and API names in
single quotes (e.g. 'caret') in Description.
* Replaced \dontrun{} by \donttest{} in Rd-files. 

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Other tests passed
- Travis CI
- AppVeyor
- rhub::check_for_cran()

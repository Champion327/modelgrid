Title: A Framework for Training Multiple Models Using the Caret Package
Version: 0.7.0.0
Authors@R: person("Lars", "Kjeldgaard", email = "lars_kjeldgaard@hotmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A minimal framework to construct and train multiple models using 
    the caret package. A model grid consists of two components: a set of 
    settings that are shared by all models, and specifications that apply only 
    to the indivual models. When the model grid is trained, model specifications 
    are first consolidated from the shared and the model specific settings and 
    hence can be trained using the 'train' function from 'caret'.

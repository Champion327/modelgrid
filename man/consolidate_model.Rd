\title{Consolidate model and training settings in model grid}
\usage{
consolidate_model(shared_settings, model)
}
\arguments{
\item{shared_settings}{\code{list} settings that are shared by all models.}

\item{model}{\code{list} with the individual specifications of a model in a
model grid.}
}
\value{
\code{list} with a complete model and training specification, that
can be trained using the 'caret' package.
}
\description{
Consolidate model and training settings from the shared settings and the model
specific settings. In case there is an overlap between the two, the model
specific settings will apply.
